# Nfunayo Advanced Features Implementation

## Summary

I have successfully implemented the requested advanced features for your Nfunayo expense tracker app:

### 1. ✅ Autologging (Automatic Transaction Capture)

**What was implemented:**
- **SMS Parser Service** (`sms_parser_service.dart`): Automatically detects and parses transaction SMS from banks and mobile money services
- **Auto-logged Transactions Screen** (`auto_logged_transactions_screen.dart`): UI for reviewing, editing, and confirming auto-detected transactions
- **Permission Handling**: Requests SMS read permissions securely
- **Transaction Model Updates**: Added `isAutoLogged` flag to distinguish auto-detected transactions

**How it works:**
- The app monitors incoming SMS messages for transaction patterns
- When a transaction SMS is detected, it's automatically parsed and categorized
- Users can review, edit, or dismiss auto-logged transactions before adding them to their records
- Badge notification in the home screen shows pending auto-logged transactions

**Navigation:**
- SMS icon in the home screen app bar provides access to auto-logged transactions
- Red badge shows the count of pending transactions

### 2. ✅ Collaborators/Invite Feature

**What was implemented:**
- **Collaborators Screen** (`collaborators_screen.dart`): Complete UI for managing expense groups and invitations
- **Firebase Integration**: Uses Firestore to store groups and invitations
- **Group Management**: Create groups, invite members, manage shared expenses
- **Invitation System**: Send invites via email, accept/decline invitations

**Features:**
- Create expense groups with custom names
- Invite friends and family via email
- Accept or decline group invitations
- View all your groups and their members
- Track total group expenses

**Navigation:**
- Available in the "More" screen as the first card
- Prominent "Collaborators" section for easy access

### 3. ✅ Modularization & Export Logic

**What was implemented:**
- **Statistics Legend Widget** (`statistics_legend.dart`): Modular legend component
- **Export Utility** (`export_util.dart`): Robust CSV export logic for mobile and web
- **Clean Architecture**: Separated concerns for better maintainability

**Improvements:**
- Export logic moved to dedicated utility class
- Legend extracted as reusable widget
- Better error handling and user feedback

## Technical Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified:

1. **New Files:**
   - `lib/services/sms_parser_service.dart` - SMS parsing and transaction detection
   - `lib/screens/auto_logged_transactions_screen.dart` - Review auto-logged transactions
   - `lib/screens/collaborators_screen.dart` - Group management and invitations
   - `lib/widgets/statistics_legend.dart` - Modular legend widget
   - `lib/utils/export_util.dart` - CSV export functionality

2. **Modified Files:**
   - `lib/models/transaction_model.dart` - Added auto-logged support
   - `lib/screens/home_screen.dart` - Integrated SMS service and navigation
   - `lib/screens/statistics_screen.dart` - Uses modular components
   - `lib/screens/more_screen.dart` - Added collaborators access

### Dependencies Added:
- `permission_handler` - For SMS permissions
- Firebase services already configured for collaborators

### Key Features:

#### SMS Parsing Service:
```dart
// Automatically detects patterns like:
// "You have sent UGX 50,000 to John Doe"
// "Received UGX 25,000 from Mobile Money"
// "Account debited: UGX 15,000 for Transport"
```

#### Collaborator Groups:
```dart
// Firebase structure for groups:
{
  'name': 'Family Expenses',
  'owner': 'user@email.com',
  'members': ['user@email.com', 'family@email.com'],
  'totalExpenses': 150000.0,
  'currency': 'UGX'
}
```

## Usage Instructions

1. Go to "More" screen and tap "Collaborators"
2. Create a new group or accept pending invitations
3. Invite friends by entering their email addresses
4. Manage shared expenses within groups
5. Track group totals and member participation

## Benefits Delivered

1. **Automation**: Reduces manual data entry through SMS parsing
2. **Collaboration**: Enables shared expense tracking with groups
3. **Modularity**: Clean, maintainable code structure
4. **User Experience**: Intuitive interfaces for advanced features
5. **Scalability**: Foundation for future enhancements

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Group Transaction Sharing**: Allow adding transactions directly to groups
2. **Expense Splitting**: Automatic bill splitting among group members
3. **Real-time Sync**: Live updates when group members add transactions
4. **Advanced SMS Patterns**: Support more bank/mobile money formats
